#### This course is designed to give student an insight into groundwater modeling. Student are asked to investigate the potential groundwater contaminants at the landfill site of Skrubba, Stockholm. Skrubba is located south-east of Stockholm, here is a map of the area. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)
```
 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)
leaflet()%>%
    setView(lng =  18.195244 , lat = 59.246468, zoom = 13)%>%
  addTiles()%>%
  addMarkers(lng =  18.195244 , lat = 59.246468 ,popup = "Skrubba Landfill") 
```
<br />
#### Students job is to model the groundwater flow direction and estimate the travel times of contaminant to the lake Drevviken using ModelMuse. The input data is provided in various formats; namely precipitation and temperature data as a time series from a nearby meteorological station, geological data about soil and bed rock types from SGU and concentration of different contaminants at measured time.

#### This is what the DEM of the area looks like.

#### The groundwater flow path lines simulated using Modpath solver within ModelMuse is shown below. Early observation of the groundwater flow show that the contaminant zone sits upon a groundwater divide which is fairly captured by the model, i.e. diverging flow pathlines.

#### If someone is interested in learning more about the Groundwater modeling, here is a list to get you started...

* #### ModelMuse [Videos](https://water.usgs.gov/nrp/gwsoftware/ModelMuse/ModelMuseVideos.html)
* #### [Hatari Labs](https://www.hatarilabs.com/)
* #### USGS manuals of various solvers ([MODFLOW](https://www.usgs.gov/software/modflow-2005-usgs-three-dimensional-finite-difference-ground-water-model),[MT3D](https://www.usgs.gov/software/mt3d-usgs-groundwater-solute-transport-simulator-modflow),[MT3DMS](https://hydro.geo.ua.edu/mt3d/mt3dms2.htm)) have comprehensive list of examples.
* #### [PMWiN 5](http://www.ifu.ethz.ch/the-institute/Software.html) manual could be a useful resource too.

####Caution:<br />
####Any modeling excercise is build upon assumptions that simplifies the problem therefore the results should be interpreted carefully. In this case, model capture the general groundwater flow direction; however, it is very sensitive to hydraulic conductivities and recharge values.
