The coupling of Gibbs energy in anabolic (biosynthesis) and catabolic biochemical reactions form a basis for the energy requirements of microorganisms growth. In aerobic decomposition processes, metabolic products as a results of oxidative substrate are CO2 and H2O, furthermore, the substrate act as the carbon as well as the energy source. The global growth reaction is often associated with negative enthalpy change which result in the heat release from the system. This heat can be measured using micro-Calorimeter. In this study, we formulate a mass-energy balance model for SOM decomposition to explain the observed heat released. We also synthesize the thermodynamic based efficiency measures in the context of SOM decomposition and provide a general theoretical base for estimating biomass yield from routine thermodynamic measurement.\nDecomposition model: Substrate added is glucose (\\({C_6H_{12}O_6}\\)) and average formula for biomass is \\(CH_{1.8}O_{0.5}N_{0.2}\\); \\(\\mu\\), \\(m_s\\), and \\(k_d\\) are the specific growth rate, the maintenance rate, and the mortality of the microorganisms respectively.\n\r","date":1555286400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555286400,"objectID":"35ca51d2434c4866b7a1ec33254b433c","permalink":"/project/phd-project/bioenergetics/bioenergetics-project/","publishdate":"2019-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/phd-project/bioenergetics/bioenergetics-project/","section":"project","summary":"Energetics based model of microbial decomposition of SOM","tags":["PhD"],"title":"Bioenergetics Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Projects"],"content":"\rTopic:\rThe importance of spatially heterogeneous distribution of substrate at the micro-scale in soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics has been shown both experimentally and in modeling studies; however, a theoretical framework for understanding the effects of micro-scale heterogeneities on the macroscopic rate of decomposition of soil organic matter is lacking. Here, we attempt to develop this theory.\nNovelty:\rMicrobial explicit SOM decomposition use mathematical formulations developed for well-mixed conditions. We demonstrate mathematically that these models fail to capture carbon dynamics in a spatially heterogeneous environment, and for the first time, we provide a mathematical framework to link the effects of micro-scale (pore scale) spatial heterogeneities on the dynamics of C fluxes at the macro-scale (soil core).\n\rImportance:\rThe distribution of organic substrates and microorganisms in soils is spatially heterogeneous at the micro-scale. Most soil carbon cycling models do not account for this micro-scale heterogeneity, motivating the development of a macro-scale model that can account for micro-scale heterogeneities. To meet this need, we use scale transition theory to analytically link micro- and macro-scale dynamics in a two dimensional spatially heterogeneous medium. Using scale transition theory, we show that the second-order spatial moments of substrate and microorganisms should be included in a macro-scale carbon model because these moments exhibit a dynamic behaviour that alters the mean dynamics of SOM decomposition.\n\rSummary for layman\rAn accurate representation of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition dynamics in large scale Earth system models is required for a better prediction of carbon storage and its fluxes. Often soil scientists simplify the dynamics of soil carbon decomposition by assuming soils as well-mixed homogeneous compartments of varying substrate quality and microorganisms. However, soils are naturally heterogeneous, which results in a non-uniform spatial distribution of substrate carbon as well as microorganisms inhabiting it. Here, we introduce a methodology to account for spatial heterogeneities in soil carbon cycling models and discuss the limitations of using traditional models that neglect spatial variability.\n\r\r","date":1555286400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555286400,"objectID":"b9238cc6eb3b244aee83a17a5cf390c4","permalink":"/project/phd-project/upscaling/phd-project/","publishdate":"2019-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/phd-project/upscaling/phd-project/","section":"project","summary":"How does soil spatially heterogeneous distribution affects organic matter dynamics?","tags":["PhD"],"title":"Upscaling Project","type":"project"},{"authors":["A.
